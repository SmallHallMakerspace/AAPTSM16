% Physics Innovation and Entrepreneurship at a Liberal Arts University
%
% The Small Hall Makerspace in the Physics Department at the College of William & Mary, Virginia, provides students with access to equipment that is usually only found in research labs and machine shops, off-limits to all but a few. By encouraging an ecosystem of student clubs and the integration of makerspace activities in courses, the makerspace has expanded to provide students of both arts and sciences with a space where they can learn and innovate in interdisciplinary groups without the time pressures and rigid expectations of traditional teaching labs. In collaboration with the Entrepreneurship Center of the Business School, we are developing an entrepreneurship physics track that combines makerspace projects with development of funding proposals, business plans and management plans. At our relatively small institution without an engineering school we are using the makerspace to create experiences in innovation and entrepreneurship for our students

\begin{frame}[label=summary]{Summary}
 \begin{block}{Small Hall Makerspace at W\&M}
  \begin{itemize}
   \item The majority of physics students will enter a career that will require them to work on projects that are more similar to makerspace activities than to solving homework problems: we should provide them with the experiences to be successful in these kinds of projects.
   \item At a liberal arts institution without innovation and entrepreneurship activities, physics departments are uniquely placed to benefit at minimal cost from the possibilities of the maker movement.
  \end{itemize}
 \end{block}
 \begin{block}{The PIPELINE Network}
  \begin{itemize}
   \item The PIPELINE Network is a three year project bringing together the efforts of six institutions to create and document new approaches to teaching innovation and entrepreneurship in physics, supported by the National Science Foundation Division of Undergraduate Education.
  \end{itemize}

 \end{block}
 \begin{block}{Physics department at William \& Mary}
  \begin{itemize}
   \item Approximately 30 undergrad majors and 8 graduate students each year (recently cut in half by dean due to federal and state funding declines)
   \item Primary preparation for graduate school (as in most physics programs)
   \item Desire to prepare students better for the careers that await them
  \end{itemize}
 \end{block}

\begin{frame}{Careers for Physicists Primarily Outside Academia}
 \begin{block}{Bachelors degrees in physics}
  \begin{itemize}
   \item Only 1 out of 6 physicists gets a PhD degree (AIP SRC)
   \item All other physicists not included in ``traditional physicists'' interpretation

 \begin{block}{PhD degrees in physics}
  \begin{itemize}
   \item Majority of permanent jobs are outside of academia
   \item About 1700 physics PhDs per year, significantly fewer jobs in academia

 \begin{block}{Mismatch between curriculum and reality of physics teaching}
  \begin{itemize}
   \item How can we prepare our undergraduate and graduate students better for their most likely career?

\begin{frame}{JLab's Lengthening Expt-Cycle Pushes Students Out Of Physics}
 \begin{block}{Time frame from proposal to data-taking now several years}
  \begin{itemize}
   \item None of the current Ph.D. students in my group will see data taking on the primary experiment they work on (MOLLER, maybe not even PREx-II which was an early off-ramp already)
   \item I simply cannot (get) support (for) a grad student exclusively to work on MOLLER or SoLID, let alone EIC.
   \item Scheduling is driving faculty to explore other projects, preferably in NP at other institutions (Mainz), preferably still in NP, but often elsewhere
  \end{itemize}
 \end{block}
 \begin{block}{Students are aware of this evolution and starting to consider this}
  \begin{itemize}
   \item We used to get students interested in training big data; not anymore\ldots
   \item Then we got students interested in data taking and collaborative research; not anymore\ldots
   \item Even students performing graduate research now are looking for pivot to technology applications
  \end{itemize}
 \end{block}

\begin{frame}{What Opportunities Can We Provide?}
 \begin{block}{Inside the curriculum: Engineering Physics and Applied Design}

 \begin{block}{Small Hall Makerspace}
  \begin{itemize}
   \item Formed in Fall 2013 for interdisciplinary team-based projects
   \item ``We provide the tools, students bring their creativity''
  \end{itemize}
 \end{block}
 \begin{block}{Encourage failure as fundamental to innovation}
  \begin{itemize}
   \item Instill ``fail early, fail often'' attitude

 \begin{block}{Value prototyping process over the solution itself}
  \begin{itemize}
   \item Students have strong theoretical basis but weaker practical experience
   \item Students are used to getting to ``right'' answer on straightforward path
   \item Laboratory exercises (even if self-guided and not recipe-driven) still often follow a predictable path towards a single solution

\begin{frame}{Equity and Inclusion in Entrepreneurship}
 \begin{block}{Combination of two problematic fields requires some thought}
  \begin{itemize}
   \item Careful attention to how student project groups are composed
   \item Gentle nudges to consider actively attracting students from many backgrounds
   \item Zero-tolerance policy for any language or behavior that affects welcoming atmosphere
   \item Active attempts to use outreach activities as a way to engage students who may not feel comfortable in typical makerspace
   \item Hiring of undergraduate assistant coordinators with connections to other departments (current undergraduate coordinator organized Dear Rosalind makerspace club that explicitly addresses equity)

\begin{frame}[allowframebreaks]{Institutional Barriers Against Physics I\&E}
 \begin{block}{Missing intra- and external institutional links}
  \begin{itemize}
   \item Silo-ization of academia: strict separation between A\&S depts, VIMS, School of L/B/Ed (currently setting up industry partnership forum across A\&S depts, School of B; already exists at VIMS)
   \item Course credit revenue-sharing firewall between School of Business (entrepreneurship) and School of Arts \& Sciences (physics)
   \begin{itemize}
    \item Entrepreneurship Center instructor gets flak from their dean when giving overrides to physics students
   \end{itemize}
   \item Tech transfer office not a known resource for most faculty (no active reaching out from TTO)
   \item Most faculty allergic to learning new things (intellectual property, small business management, project management), let alone including it in teaching (APS PIPELINE network attempts to address this)
  \end{itemize}
 \end{block}
 \begin{block}{Absent alignment mechanism}
  \begin{itemize}
   \item Lack of history in engineering, entrepreneurship and institutional focus on individual liberal arts: often merely a failure of imagination (our biggest I\&E dept is arguably government through US-AID)
   \item Lack of strong connections with industry (considering APS Local Link for Hampton Roads centered around JLab)
   \item No incentives for physics faculty who are evaluated on research, not tech development (in contrast with engineering)
   \item Early ``valley of death'' between research and seed investor funding, compounded by requirements on cost-sharing for VA state grants (CRCF, CIT, VRIF) which require previous federal grants; most of the previous projects are funded through our university's own `angel investor' (IDC return on my own grants); this is a question of getting to high enough TRL for further funding, applied research resulting in MVP
